		<p>Following the path of our previous installations, Feverdream will create an alternative reality with which we physically explore alternate perceptions of our familiar environment. </p>
		<p>This will be a space that allows the reality of vulnerability to be performed and practiced. We encourage the collaboration between performer and audience by inviting the viewer to confront their own response to their surroundings and reflect on their inner voice.</p>
		<p>We will alter the space using projected video, sculpture made of precious trash, and other ephemeral materials. Each performer will build on a character and create the environment to fit that character. Feverdream will sew those spaces together, forming a culture that starts with us.</p>
