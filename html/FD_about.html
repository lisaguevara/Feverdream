	</div>
	<section>
		<p>The members of Feverdream have always fluctuated throughout the years, but they all have had one commonality that brought them together: being employees of Live Yes Studios.</p>
		<p>Live Yes Studios is a vocational art studio for adults with developmental disabilities located in Lincoln, NE. It is this haven of artistic creativity and struggle that served as the foundation of trust and friendship.</p>
		<p>Ideas of art installation and invading the public psyche birthed the first Feverdream art show on June 2017. This inspired other creatives of Live Yes to continue pursuing likeminded events on a yearly basis. Through trial and error of each art event, Feverdream aims to expand on its previous performance and continue finding new ways to get weird.</p>

A believer in creative expression used for healing, Natasha currently works at Live Yes Studios. With a focus in sculpture in school, Natasha was drawn to torch welding and the foundry like a moth to the flame. After graduating and lacking the equipment to melt metal, Natasha fueled her creative energy into cooking, gardening, sewing, and making sculptures out of trash. With a potentially unhealthy obsession of picking up trash, Natasha (or Trasha) can be seen walking into the studio each morning with handfuls of trash.</p>
