		<h2>Birth of Feverdream</h2>
	</div>
	<section>
		<p>The idea was born when artist Rachel Hardin wanted to join forces with Akin Studio and the Blueberry Center Gallery to create a performance based "experience‚Äù that focused on transitions in space and changes in mood.</p>
		<p>Her coworkers at Live Yes Studios jumped on the idea which sparked the 3-month planning process to create the ultimate artist experience. Each artist had a chance to create a character and built the environment around what that character needed.</p>
		<p>Characters were given a designated space to expand their ideas which ended with an immersive and surprisingly cohesive environment. Each performer naturally used a lot of recycled materials in their own artistic practices, so it was only natural to build the space with these same materials.</p>

		<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
	</div>
	<section>
		<p>Following the path of our previous installations, Feverdream will create an alternative reality with which we physically explore alternate perceptions of our familiar environment.</p>
		<p>This will be a space that allows the reality of vulnerability to be performed and practiced. We encourage the collaboration between performer and audience by inviting the viewer to confront their own response to their surroundings and reflect on their inner voice.</p>
		<p>We will alter the space using projected video, sculpture made of precious trash, and other ephemeral materials. Each performer will build on a character and create the environment to fit that character. Feverdream will sew those spaces together, forming a culture that starts with us.</p>
