FEVERDREAM COLLECTIVE TEXT
==========================
Home - History
=============
The idea was born when artist Rachel Hardin wanted to join forces with Akin Studio and the Blueberry Center Gallery to create a performance based "experience” that focused on transitions in space and changes in mood. 

Her coworkers at Live Yes Studios jumped on the idea which sparked the 3-month planning process to create the ultimate artist experience. Each artist had a chance to create a character and built the environment around what that character needed.

Characters were given a designated space to expand their ideas which ended with an immersive and surprisingly cohesive environment. Each performer naturally used a lot of recycled materials in their own artistic practices, so it was only natural to build the space with these same materials.

About Us
=============
The members of Feverdream have always fluctuated throughout the years, but they all have had one commonality that brought them together: being employees of Live Yes Studios.

Live Yes Studios is a vocational art studio for adults with developmental disabilities located in Lincoln, NE. It is this haven of artistic creativity and struggle that served as the foundation of trust and friendship. 

Ideas of art installation and invading the public psyche birthed the first Feverdream art show on June 2017. This inspired other creatives of Live Yes to continue pursuing likeminded events on a yearly basis. Through trial and error of each art event, Feverdream aims to expand on its previous performance and continue finding new ways to get weird.

Rachel Hardin:
Rachel Hardin received her Bachelors in Fine Art from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln where she studied drawing.

She currently lives in Nebraska.


Becca Raleigh:
Becca Raleigh is a portrait and installation artist. Karre earned her BFA at the University of Nebraska. "My work focuses on transition/transformation. Growth has its own beauty and it is often a painful process. My work is about embracing the pain as a part of the growing process. I am still working on welcoming pain as a dear friend." 

Micah Snyder:
Micah received his BFA from the University Nebraska-Lincoln and MFA from Ohio University. Traditionally trained as a print-maker specializing in etchings, Micah has most recently been working collaboratively with Springboard Collective to make site-specific, interactive, and immersive sculptural environments focusing on transforming the physical and psychological aspects of fun through socially engaged events. While at Live Yes Micah has taught a variety of classes including but not limited to; Relief printing, Paper Marbling, and Drawing Sound. In his off time Micah enjoys making bad techno music, art about chicken-strips, and is currently preparing to compete in the world karate tournament in Okinawa, Japan.

Lisa Guevara:
Lisa Guevara received her Bachelors in Fine Arts at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2015. Lisa has been included in a number of regional solo and groups shows in Tugboat Gallery (Lincoln, NE), Petshop Gallery (Omaha, NE), and Plug Projects (Kansas City, MO). With a degree emphasizing in ceramics and painting, she now incorporates recyclables, found objects, and other non traditional materials to break away from conventional expectations of each medium. Lisa currently creates and lives in Texas.

Natasha Scholz:
Natasha Scholz received her Bachelor’s degree in Art and Psychology from UNL in 2012. A believer in creative expression used for healing, Natasha currently works at Live Yes Studios. With a focus in sculpture in school, Natasha was drawn to torch welding and the foundry like a moth to the flame. After graduating and lacking the equipment to melt metal, Natasha fueled her creative energy into cooking, gardening, sewing, and making sculptures out of trash. With a potentially unhealthy obsession of picking up trash, Natasha (or Trasha) can be seen walking into the studio each morning with handfuls of trash.

Stephanie Wright:
Stephanie Wright grew up in Louisiana and earned a Masters in Visual Art from the University of Nebraska Lincoln. She is an art instructor, mentor and artist in various mediums, mainly printmaking and drawing. Her work explores emotions and relationships within the human condition, always visually and conceptually inspired by a fascination with nature and non-human existence.

Upcoming Events
=============
2021:
Following the path of our previous installations, Feverdream will create an alternative reality with which we physically explore alternate perceptions of our familiar environment. 

This will be a space that allows the reality of vulnerability to be performed and practiced. We encourage the collaboration between performer and audience by inviting the viewer to confront their own response to their surroundings and reflect on their inner voice.

We will alter the space using projected video, sculpture made of precious trash, and other ephemeral materials. Each performer will build on a character and create the environment to fit that character. Feverdream will sew those spaces together, forming a culture that starts with us.


==========================
Past Events
=============
2019:

Created by the familiar and growing collective of artists that brought you the first two Feverdream performances, “Delighted” is an interactive installation loosely inspired by the symbols within Hieronymous Bosch’s “The Garden of Earthly Delights.”

Performers include: Brynne Biles, Adam D’Josey, Lisa Guevara, Rachel Hardin, Emma Krenzer, Kirsten McCormack, Natasha Scholz, Micah Snyder, Wes Staley and Stephanie Wright held at Project Project on September’s Second Friday.

Become immersed in a world of innocence and debauchery, freedom and order, nature and artifice; Viewers are encouraged to move through the installation, confront their own response to their environment and therefore join in the performance. Enter and be delighted.

=============
2018:

Inspired by the iridescent interactive installation that was the original FEVERDREAM, a group of artists come together to bring you another interactive experience simply known as FEVERDREAM 2.

Lisa Guevara, Nick the Butcher, Jessica Prenosil, Natasha Scholz, Wes Staley, Amber Stevens, and Stephanie Wright will be performing at Tugboat Gallery on August First Friday from 7-10pm. 

These artists will physically interpret dual forces of existence within a gradated terrain of precious trash, meat, and fabric. Through pain and healing, the natural and the artificial, light and darkness, FEVERDREAM 2 allows the reality of vulnerability to be performed and practiced. Visitors are encouraged to howl with the grief-stricken, celebrate with death, and investigate the inner voice.
